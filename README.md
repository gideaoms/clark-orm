# ClarkORM

ClarkORM is a [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) ORM built on top of [Lucid ORM](https://preview.adonisjs.com/guides/database/introduction) (AdonisJS V5).

## Why

[AdonisJS](https://adonisjs.com/) is a great framework and it has one of the best ORM. But it works only in its ecosystem. Using ClarkORM you can have all the benefits of Lucid, but in any project you want.

## How it works

ClarkORM is built on top of Lucid ORM and Lucid ORM is built on top of [knex](http://knexjs.org/). The idea of ClarkORM is let you manage yours *migrations* and *seeds* with knex the way you already do. But when it comes to Models ClarkORM comes on scene.

## Installation

```sh
npm install clark-orm
npm install reflect-metadata
```

## Usage

```ts
import { DateTime } from "luxon";
import { BaseModel, column } from "clark-orm/Orm";

export class CityModel extends BaseModel {
  public static table = "cities";

  @column({ isPrimary: true, serializeAs: null })
  public id!: number;

  @column()
  public name!: string;

  @column.dateTime({ autoCreate: true })
  public createdAt!: DateTime;

  @column.dateTime({ autoCreate: true, autoUpdate: true })
  public updatedAt!: DateTime;
}
```

You can learn more about the models [here](https://preview.adonisjs.com/guides/models/introduction).

*We use the variables contained in the knexfile because Lucid ORM is built on top of knex*

## Extra

To use ClarkORM you need to know at least a little about [knex](http://knexjs.org/) and [Lucid](https://preview.adonisjs.com/guides/models/introduction)
